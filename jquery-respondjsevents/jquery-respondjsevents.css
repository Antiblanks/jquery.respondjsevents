/**
 * This file assumes you have three supported view modes: mobile, tablet and desktop and that your break points are mobile:1px-480px, tablet:481px-1024px, desktop:1025px-infinity
 * You will need to edit this file and change these break points to marry the CSS3 media queries with your own so that they match.
 * For each view mode you support add another media query, i.e; If you support a view mode in between tablet and desktop then you would add something like:

	@media screen and (min-width: 727px) {
		#respond-js-events .respond-js-view-mode {
			display: none;
		}

		#respond-js-events .respond-js-view-mode[data-view-mode='tablet-2'] {
			display: block;
		}
	}

 * Then add the new view mode to your markup, for the above example you would add:

 	<div class="respond-js-view-mode" data-view-mode="tablet-2"></div>

 * So you would have:

 	<div id="respond-js-events">
		<div class="respond-js-view-mode" data-view-mode="mobile"></div>
		<div class="respond-js-view-mode" data-view-mode="tablet"></div>
		<div class="respond-js-view-mode" data-view-mode="tablet-2"></div>
		<div class="respond-js-view-mode" data-view-mode="desktop"></div>
	</div>

 * 
 * You can add as many view modes as you need to marry with your existing CSS3 media queries.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: 
 *
 * The reason you need these to match your existing CSS3 media queries is that when Respond.js applies the queries for each view mode your custom styles 
 * will be applied and the correct view mode tag will also be displayed. This is how the plugin can tell that the view mode has changed.
