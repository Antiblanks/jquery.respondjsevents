# jquery.respondjsevents
A JQuery plugin to poll Respond.js DOM updates and fire an event when Respond.js has applied psuedo CSS3 media queries

Why use this plugin?
======

When using the plugin Respond.js (https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) to apply CSS3 media queries on older browsers such as IE8 you may want to know when your styles have been applied and Respond.js currently doesn't have a way of notifying you. You can hack the plugin to fire an event but you may not be able to edit the code or you may just wish to use a solution which does not involve changing plugin logic.
